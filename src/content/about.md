I'm Oscar Chavez.

I'm a web/mobile developer 📱, software engineer ⚙️, cloud architect ☁️ and project manager 📨.

Formerly, I was CTO at a software company I co-founded, 🔻[VR3.io](https://vr3.io/), where I did a lot of interesting work, met awesome people and had the chance to grow very quickly as an engineer, manager and entrepreneur.

I've done a lot of _on-site_, _remote_ and _temporary contract_ jobs with clients (mainly) from Mexico 🇲🇽, but also from US 🇺🇸 and Europe 🇪🇺.

Meetups, events and conferences are something I'm always looking to assist or participate in. I'm always up to help the industry grow, give some career advice and meet amazing people 😎.

Also I love (to win) hackathons 🏆!
