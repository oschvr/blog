By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

> What is the 10 001st prime number?

At first glance, a simple iteration whilst checking if index position is
prime, would suffice.

A _pseudocode_ attempt:

```
 sum = 0
 for i = 2; i <= ?; i++ {
   if(isPrime(i)){
    sum++ if ( sum >= 10001) {
      return i
    }
  }
}
```

Using the solution in **go** to check if is prime from former examples:

```go
func isPrime(x int64) bool
{
  var i int64 = 2
  for ; i < x; i++ {
    if x%i == 0 {
      return false
    }
  }
return true }
```

The solution would scale to

$$
O(n^2)
$$

This is not viable. Also, there's no upper bound to set our iteration limit, meaning,
we don't know up to which number we should iterate to find the **10,001 prime**.

So digging further, I found about the **[Erathostenes Sieve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)**:

> An ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit

This is exactly what we need. Let's look at the procedure:

> To find all the prime
> numbers less than or equal to a given integer **n** by Erathostenes' method:

1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 ... n (2,3,4,...,_n_)
2. Initially, let _p_ equal 2, smallest prime.
3. Enumerate multiples of _p_ by counting in increments of p from _2p_ to _n_, and mark them in the list (these will be _2p, 3p, 4p, ...;_ the _p_ itself should not be marked)
4. Find the first number greater than _p_ in the list that is not marked, if there is not such number, stop. Otherwise, let _p_ now equal to this number (which is next prime), and repeat step 3
5. When algorithm terminates, the numbers remain not marked in the list, are all primes below n.

Here's the code I came up:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
    "time"
)
func primeSieve(n, limit int) int {
    // Create and populate array of values
    // lim := c
    a: = make([] bool, limit + 1)
    for i: = 0;i < limit + 1;i++{
        a[i] = true
    }
    // Start with 2
    // p _ p <= limit === p <= int(math.Sqrt(float64(limit)))
    for p: = 2;p <= int(math.Sqrt(float64(limit)));p++{
        // At first all will be true
        if a[p] == true {
            // i = 2 _ 2, i = 3 _ 2, i = 4 _ 2, ..., i = i _ i
            // Calculate multiples of 2, then 3, then 5, then 7
            for i: = p _ 2;
            i <= limit;
            i += p {
                a[i] = false
            }
        }
    }

    // Count primes up to n
    // if primes == 10001, return sievePrime
    var primes, sievePrime int
    for p: = 2;p <= limit;p++{
        if a[p] == true {
            primes++
            // Sum up primes and print 10,001th prime
            if primes <= n {
                sievePrime = p
            }
        }
    }
    return sievePrime
}

func main() {
    start: = time.Now()
        // Nth prime to find
    var n, limit int = 10001,
        105000 // Arbitrary limit find by  testing

    fmt.Println("Execution time: ", time.Since(start))
    fmt.Println("10,001th Prime: ", primeSieve(n, limit))
}
```

Execution time: 194ns

Answe
10,001th Prime: **104743**
