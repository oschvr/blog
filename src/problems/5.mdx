2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

> What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

At first glance, and as a concept refresher, we'll have to use **GCD* and **LCM**.

- **[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)**
  stands for _Greatest Common Divisor_. **GCD** is the largest number that divides
  the given numbers.
- **[LCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple)**
  stands for _Lowest Common Multiple_. **LCM** is the smallest number that is multiple
  of _a_ and _b_.

To find the **LCM**, we can use the following formula:

$$
lcm(a,b) =  frac{ | ab | }{gcd(a, b)}
$$

But before that, we must find the _GCD_.
For that, we'll use the [Euclid's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm),
which consists of an efficient way to calculate the greatest common divisor. The
algorithm is described:

$$
gcd(a,0) = a
$$

$$
space b)
$$

And converting it to a recursive function:

```go{numberLines: true}
func gcd(a, b int64) int64 {
  c := a % b
  if c == 0 {
    return b
  }
  return gcd(b, c)
}
```

Then, we can write our simple function to get the **LCM**:

```go
func lcm(a, b int64) int64 {
  return a * b /gcd(a, b)
}
```

Finally, we'll iterate from 1 ... 20 starting with 2, and we'll calculate the _Lowest Common Multiplier_ of every digit.

```go{numberLines: 3}
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
)

func main() {
  start := time.Now()
  var a, i int64 = 1, 2
  for ; i <= 20; i++ {
    a = lcm(a, i)
  }
  fmt.Println("Execution time: ", time.Since(start))
  fmt.Println("Smallest Multiple: ", a)
}

func lcm(a, b int64) int64 {
  return a * b / gcd(a, b)
}

func gcd(a, b int64) int64 {
  c := a % b
  if c == 0 {
    return b
  }
  return gcd(b, c)
}
```

Execution time: 1.416Âµs
