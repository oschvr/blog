The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

$$
1^x1D2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
$$

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

$$
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
$$

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

> Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum

Clearly there are two parts needed to solve the problem. Let's take a look to each one:

#### Sum of the squares of N

We will create a function that accepts parameter N, and calculates the sum of squares.

```go
func sumSquares(N
  int64) int64 {
  var i int64 = 1
  var sum int64
  for ; i <= N; i++ {
    sum += i * i
  }
  return sum
}
```

I ran this alone with **N = 10** and the results were:

> Sum of Squares: 385
> Execution Time: 43.542µs

Pretty fast!

With **N = 100**, the results were:

> Sum of Squares: 338350
> Execution Time: 29.438µs

It was even faster...

#### Square of the sum of N

For the second part we'll do more or less the same but instead we'll first sum everything and then elevate it.

```go
func squareSum(N int64) int64
  {
  var i int64 = 1
  var sum int64
  for ; i <= N; i++ {
    sum += i
  }
  return sum * sum
}
```

With **N = 10**:

> Square of Sum of N: 3025
> Execution Time: 38.978µs

And with **N = 100**

> Square of Sum of N: 25502500
> Execution Time: 39.731µs

_~1.3µs_ of difference... I really like Go.

Finally we'll substract the later with the former.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
)

func
  sumSquares(N int64) int64 {
  var i int64 = 1
  var sum int64
  for ; i <= N;
  i++ {
    sum += i * i
  }
  return sum
}

func squareSum(N int64) int64 {
  var
  i int64 = 1
  var sum int64
  for ; i <= N; i++ {
    sum += i
  }
  return
  sum * sum
}

func main() {
  start := time.Now()
  const N = 100
  fmt.Println("Execution Time:", time.Since(start))
  fmt.Println("Sum of Squares of N minus Square of Sum of N: ", squareSum(N)-sumSquares(N))
}
```

Execution Time: _31.696µs_

Answer
Sum of Squares of N minus Square of Sum of N: **25164150**"
