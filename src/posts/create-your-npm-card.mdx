Lately, our company started growing so I had to start interviewing frontend engineers, UI/UX designers and other developers who focus on the UI aspect of web development

At first, my expectation was that the process wouldn't involve anything else but talking to a person. I was caught off guard about the fact that a lot these amazing developers shared with me their portfolios, websites or even demos. It was surprising and inspiring to see some of the creative ways people standout.

Because of the simplicity and coolness, one caught my eye as something I could do for myself in less than 15 minutes.

So I [did it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oschvr), you can test it out in your terminal and of course, I'll show you how to do it. See below 👇

---

### How to run

> This assumes you have `node` and `npm` installed in your system

1.  Open your **`Terminal`**
2.  Type **`npx oschvr`** and hit enter

npx oschvr

The command will output a nicely formatted ASCII card with my contact information in your terminal. _-Nice 😎_

It works just like `npm`, in the sense that it retrieves packages from the NPM (node package manager) registry, except that `npx` will execute node binaries, if any.

[See more about `npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)

Essentially, the command:

- Will pull the code
- Fetch the dependencies and
- Run the binary

Incredibly simple, yet, this same system is being used in more advanced and complex projects.

### Creating your own

First, things first:

- Create a folder and go into it, `mkdir card && cd card`
- Create a new project, `npm init -y`
- Open your new created project in your code editor, `code .`

Now that you have a new project, go to `package.json`and make sure you have at least the following keys: `name, main, bin, author, license`

- In `name`, enter the package name (this is the name you will call in `npx`)
- In `main` and `bin` enter `index.js` as value, we'll continue here in the next step
- In `author`, enter your name or email, this one is optional, but I guess it doesn't hurt since your  giving out your contact info anyways.
- In `license`, go to [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/) and pick one.

```json
{
  "name": "oschvr",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "description": "oschvr.com",
  "main": "index.js",
  "bin": "index.js",
  "keywords": ["oschvr"],
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/oschvr/card"
  },
  "files": ["index.js"],
  "author": "Oscar Chavez <oschvr@protonmail.com>",
  "license": "The Unlicense",
  "dependencies": {
    "boxen": "^4.2.0",
    "chalk": "^4.1.0"
  }
}
```

package.json

Note that I already have two dependencies, `chalk`and `boxen`. To install them

- Go to your terminal and enter `npm install chalk boxen`

- chalk@4.1.0
- boxen@4.2.0

```shell
added 4 packages from 2 contributors,
removed 4 packages,
updated 21 packages and audited 25 packages in 1.362s
found 0 vulnerabilities
```

- Create a new file `index.js` and open it

As you specified in the `package.json`, this is your `main` file (entry) / `bin` (binary) file.

- To specify that `index.js` is a binary file, start with the following:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

_node binary_

- Add the dependencies you installed earlier

```js
const boxen = require('boxen')
const chalk = require('chalk')
```

_dependencies_

> See more about [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) and [boxen](https://github.com/sindresorhus/boxen)

- Create an `options` object for the surrounding box

```javascript
const options = {
  padding: 1,
  margin: 1,
  borderStyle: 'round',
}
```

boxen options

- Next, create a `data` object with whatever information you want to include

```javascript
const data = {
  name: chalk.white.bold(' Oscar Chavez / oschvr'),
  role: chalk.white.bold(' Cloud 🌥 & Software 🛠 Engineer'),
  twitter: {
    label: chalk.white.bold('Twitter 🐦:'),
    url: chalk.blue.underline('https://twitter.com/oschvr'),
  },
  github: {
    label: chalk.white.bold('Github 🐙:'),
    url: chalk.blue.underline('https://github.com/oschvr'),
  },
  email: {
    label: chalk.white.bold('Email 📧:'),
    url: chalk.blue.underline('oschvr@protonmail.com'),
  },
  web: {
    label: chalk.white.bold('Web 💻:'),
    url: chalk.blue.underline('https://oschvr.com'),
  },
}
```

personal information

- Next, create the `card`

```javascript
const newline = "\n";
nconst twitter = `${data.twitter.label} ${data.twitter.url}`;
nconst github = `${data.github.label} ${data.github.url}`;
nconst email = `${data.email.label} ${data.email.url}`;
nconst web = `${data.web.label} ${data.web.url}`;
nconst card =
    boxen(data.name +
        newline +
        newline +
        data.role +
        newline +
        newline +
        twitter +
        newline +
        github +
        newline +
        email +
        newline +
        web, options);

```

There are a lot of ways you can achieve something you like. I found that in my case, this is where I was tweaking the most.

- Finally, log the result to the terminal.

```javascript
console.log(chalk.white.bold(card))
```

All together

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
const boxen = require("boxen");
const chalk = require("chalk");

const options = {
    padding: 1,
    margin: 1,
    borderStyle: "round",
};

const data = {
    name: chalk.white.bold(" Oscar Chavez / oschvr"),
    role: chalk.white.bold(" Cloud 🌥 & Software 🛠 Engineer"),
    twitter: {
        label: chalk.white.bold("Twitter 🐦:"),
        url: chalk.blue.underline("https://twitter.com/oschvr"),
    },
    github: {
        label: chalk.white.bold("Github 🐙:"),
        url: chalk.blue.underline("https://github.com/oschvr"),
    },
    email: {
        label: chalk.white.bold("Email 📧:"),
        url: chalk.blue.underline("oschvr@protonmail.com"),
    },
    web: {
        label: chalk.white.bold("Web 💻:"),
        url: chalk.blue.underline("https://oschvr.com"),
    },
};

const newline = "\n";
nconst twitter = `${data.twitter.label} ${data.twitter.url}`;
nconst github = `${data.github.label} ${data.github.url}`;
nconst email = `${data.email.label} ${data.email.url}`;
nconst web = `${data.web.label} ${data.web.url}`;
nconst card =
    boxen(data.name +
        newline +
        newline +
        data.role +
        newline +
        newline +
        twitter +
        newline +
        github +
        newline +
        email +
        newline +
        web, options);

```

To test your newly created node program,

- Open the terminal and enter `node index.js`

```shell
os at os-mac in ~/o/b/card (master|✚2)=» node index.js

```

Once you're happy with the result, it's time to publish it so people can use it through `npx`

### Publishing to NPM

The `npm` utility has a the command `publish` that is pretty self explanatory. The only requirement is that you need an account at NPM. [Create your account here]("https://www.npmjs.com/signup")

There are a lot of things you can do when publishing to the NPM registry, but these are out of the scope of this tutorial.

> Here's a great article of [how to publish to the npm]("https://zellwk.com/blog/publish-to-npm/")

- Run `npm publish` and wait for it to finish.

### Test it out

If all went well,

- Enter `npx <name>` where _name_ is the package name you specified in `package.json`

and that's it ! You should see your freshly created `npm` card that you can distribute to friends, colleagues and even recruiters.

### Repo

I purposely used a [_free to use and distribute_]("https://unlicense.org/") license, so go and clone it or fork it and make yours  👉  [https://github.com/oschvr/card]("https://github.com/oschvr/card").
