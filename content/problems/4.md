title: Largest palindrome product
---

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

> Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers

The first observation is that the number should be in the range of **10000**
and **998001**.
There's a couple aproaches to the problem, such as:

- Multiplicating
  two 3-digit numbers and checking the result if its a palindrome
- Creating palindromes
  and getting the factors to see if that pair is what we're looking for.

I'll go
for the first approach.
First I'll create an int reversal function to call whenever
I want to check if a number is a palindrome.

```go
func reversed(n int) int
  {
  reversed := 0
  for ; n > 0; n = n / 10 {
    reversed = 10 * reversed + n % 10
  }
  return reversed
}
```

Let me explain what this function does in 3 steps:

1. Isolate
   the last digit number from the input number(n)
2. Append the last digit to a new
   variable (reversed)
3. Remove the last digit from the input number (n)

Consider **12345** as **n**

At the first iteration (pseudocode):

```
forLoop (if n>0,
  n = ( 12345 % 10 ) ) (
  reversed = (10 * 0) + 12345 % 10
  reversed = (0) + (5)

  reversed = 5
)
n = 1234
```

At the second iteration:

```
forLoop (if
  n > 0, n = ( 1234 % 10 ) ) (
  reversed = (10 * 5) + 1234 % 10
  reversed = (5)
  + (4)
  reversed = 54
)
n = 123
```

And so on... Here is an [detailed explanation](https://medium.com/@ManBearPigCode/how-to-reverse-a-number-mathematically-97c556626ec6)
of this reversing algorithm.

Next I'll create a helper function to return true/false

```go
func
  isPalindrome(n int) bool{
  return n === reversed(n)
}
```

Lastly, we'll multiply
**a · b** to check if a result isPalindrome and iterate to find the largest palindrome.

```go
func
  main(){
  largestPalin := 0
  a := 0
  for ; a <= 999; < a++ {
    b := 100

     for ; b <= 999; b++{
      c := a*b
      if isPalindrome(c) && c > largestPalindrome{

         largestPalindrome = c
      }
    }
  }
  fmt.Println(largestPalindrome)
}
```

Here's
the code

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
)

func main()
  {
  start := time.Now()
  largestPalin := 0
  a := 0
  for ; a <= 999; a++ {
    b
  := 100
    for ; b <= 999; b++ {
      c := a * b
      if isPalindrome(c) &&
  c > largestPalin {
        largestPalin = c
      }
    }
  }
  fmt.Println("Execution time: ", time.Since(start))
  fmt.Println("Largest Palindrome: ", largestPalin)
}

func
  reversed(n int) int { // 456789
  reversed := 0 // 0
  for ; n > 0; n = n / 10
  {
    reversed = 10*reversed + n%10
  }
  return reversed
}

func isPalindrome(n
  int) bool {
  return n == reversed(n)
}

```
