Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file words.txt.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:

words.txt contains only lowercase characters and space ' ' characters.
Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.
Example:

Assume that words.txt has the following content:

```
the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is
```

Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:

```
the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1
```

Note:

- Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.
- Could you write it in one-line using Unix pipes?

## Solution

```bash
echo "clean file"
rm words.txt

echo "make file to test"
cat << EOF > words.txt
the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is
EOF

echo "run solution"
cat words.txt | tr -s ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r | awk '{ print $2, $1 }'
```
