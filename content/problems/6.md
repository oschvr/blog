The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

$$
1^x1D2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
$$

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

$$
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
$$

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

Clearly there are two parts needed to solve the problem. Let's take a look to each one:

#### Sum of the squares of N

We will create a function that accepts parameter N, and calculates the sum of squares.

```go
func sumSquares(N
  int64) int64 {
  var i int64 = 1
  var sum int64
  for ; i <= N; i++ {
    sum += i * i
  }
  return sum
}
```

I ran this alone with **N = 10** and the results were:

> Sum of Squares: 385
> Execution Time: 43.542µs

Pretty fast!

With **N = 100**, the results were:

> Sum of Squares: 338350
> Execution Time: 29.438µs

It was even faster...

#### Square of the sum of N

For the second part we'll do more or less the same but instead we'll first sum everything and then elevate it.

```go
func squareSum(N int64) int64
  {
  var i int64 = 1
  var sum int64
  for ; i <= N; i++ {
    sum += i
  }
  return sum * sum
}
```

With **N = 10**:

> Square of Sum of N: 3025
> Execution Time: 38.978µs

And with **N = 100**

> Square of Sum of N: 25502500
> Execution Time: 39.731µs

_~1.3µs_ of difference... I really like Go.

Finally we'll substract the later with the former.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
)

func
  sumSquares(N int64) int64 {
  var i int64 = 1
  var sum int64
  for ; i <= N;
  i++ {
    sum += i * i
  }
  return sum
}

func squareSum(N int64) int64 {
  var
  i int64 = 1
  var sum int64
  for ; i <= N; i++ {
    sum += i
  }
  return
  sum * sum
}

func main() {
  start := time.Now()
  const N = 100
  fmt.Println("Execution Time:", time.Since(start))
  fmt.Println("Sum of Squares of N minus Square of Sum of N: ", squareSum(N)-sumSquares(N))
}
```

Execution Time: _31.696µs_

Answer
Sum of Squares of N minus Square of Sum of N: **25164150**"
