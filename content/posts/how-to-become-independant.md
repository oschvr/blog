In this truly fast moving world, one must stop for a moment, look back and ponder what is it exactly that a man required to achieve something great by him/herself? What about if he/she could organize a group of people to achieve a much larger goal? How about when someone set to dedicate his/her entire life and the life of his/her descendants to achieve a seemingly impossible and life-lasting task?

I have the general perception that these epic journeys like building a successful business, discovering a better way to do things or just creating enough value could only be achieved by gathering immense quantities of resources, like people or knowledge, over time in a really intelligent way in the right time... or by mere a strike of luck.

Don't get me wrong, I still think it's sort of like that, but looking back, chances of creating something great were _minuscule_ since nature have always worked towards failure and while some learnt about this systemic entropy, others across the globe would tend to repeat the same mistakes, thus entrepreneurs had much narrower starting ground... But then, the human race came up with a **excessively smart solution** for tackling communication, social networking, resource sharing, entertainment, remote work and all sorts of things we could imagine, around the world ! in a matter of seconds !! Only several years have passed,but we have made a huge progress already in global subjects like economics, markets, business, politics, human development and overall technology, that has only made people get closer.

This presents one of the most incredible scenarios for Internet users of the world and their work habits. Now these independent efforts like joining someone or even becoming the head of an amazing team looking to change the world as we know it, have become really obvious, and for the first time in a very long period in humanity, easier to achieve.

I've found myself on both sides of the later situation. And when I'm not pursuing an business, I find that helping others in their journeys can become a tremendous reward. All in all, there are a couple of advices to become a much more competent entrepreneur:

- Learn the power of the Internet.
- Organize your self. Time is money.
- Never stop learning.
- If you are from a non-english country, learn English, and learn it well.

In conclusion, I'd recommend anyone reading this far that give it a try, on becoming independent. The community is not only really nice but the power of the internet is here for you to unveil.
