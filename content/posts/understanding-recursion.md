Rather than using the popular joke about **recursion** _(see bottom)_, I'll reference a very peculiar adage which makes use of this particular mental model:

The **[Hogstadter's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law)**, states that:

> It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account **Hofstadter's Law**.

See what happened there? The law is a [self-referential adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference), that tries to _describe the widely experienced difficulty of accuratelly estimate the time it will take to complete tasks of substancial complexity._

I feel it describes very much my past experience trying to objectively explain the time and budget constrains in a software project where the requirements keep changing. That should be called the **Oschvr's Law**

Anyway, back to topic.

### Definition

> **Recursion** is the process of solving a problem by dividing it into smaller version of the problem.

By this definition, whenever the **_division_** of a given problem is small enough, it will reach a **_"base case"_**, or when the problem can be solved directly.

Amazing right? _A problem's solution that calls itself to solve the problem !_

### Rationale

> Why do we need **recursion**? Can't we just use a loop and get over it?

The answer is ... **it depends**

The fact is that _mathematically_, it makes more sense to use a recursive solution for most problems and for sufficiently large inputs of those problems.

But there will be sometimes where **iterative** solutions make way more sense when the problem tends to be complicated, harder to analyse and generally less efficient with recursion.

For now, let's look at some examples of **recursive implementations** to clarify the concept.

### Example: Substraction

Let's look at a more hands on example in pseudocode:

![recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Recursive-Functions-in-c.png)

We have:

- _A function definition_
- _A base case_
- _A call to the same function_

This function will substract **1 to x**, recursively until we reach the base case **0**. Here's implemented in Go

```
func main() {
        // We want to go from 10 to 0
	fmt.Println(recursion(10))
}

func recursion(x int) int {
	if x == 0 {
		return 0
	}
	fmt.Print(x, ", ")
	return recursion(x - 1)
}
```

This will output:

```
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
```

Let's look at another example.

### Example: Factorial

Factorials are very useful in many areas of mathematics and computer science. Given that:

> A **Factorial number** is the product of every whole number from 1 to _n_

For example if **n = 3**, then **3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6**

This is another excellent case where we can apply a **recursive** algorithm to calculate the result.

In pseudocode we will _define our function_, our _base case_ and our _recursive call_.

```
// function definition
int factorial(n)

  // base case
  if (n == 0) {
    return 1
  }

  // recursive call
  n * factorial(n - 1)
```

Here's converted go Go, in order to test it:

```go
func main() {
	fmt.Println(factorial(10))
}

func factorial(n int) int {
	if n == 0 {
		return 1
	}
	return n * factorial(n-1)
}
```

The output is:

**3628800**
in 38.27µs

### Example: Fibonacci

The Fibbonacci sequence implementation is a very popular example of a recursive procedure. The formal definition states:

$If n >= 1$

$F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)$

Here's the **recursive** implementation in Go

```go
func main() {
	start := time.Now()
	n := 10
	fmt.Println(fibonacci(n))
	fmt.Println(time.Since(start))

}

// Recursive fibonacci
// function definition
func fibonacci(n int) int {
	// Base case
	if n <= 1 {
		return n
	}
	// F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
	return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
}
```

The output is

**55**
In 49.64µs

### Conclusion

**Recursion** is one of the fundamental ideas behind _Computer Science_. Although is at first a hard concept to grasp, it **can be understood with practice**.

Many efficient algorithms of sorting and searching use **recursion** at the core to efficiently reduce the computational budget and get to the result faster.

In a following blog post, I will take a look on the computational analysis of recursive algorithms using **Big O** notation, and a couple of techniques and definitions.

[Here's](https://github.com/oschvr/blog-recursion) the code repo with the examples above.
