Hey 👋, I'm **Oscar**.

## ME

Another citizen of this wonderful planet 🌍, that was born in Mexico 🇲🇽 {{< myAge >}} years ago (of course I like tacos 🌮).

I'm based between Brussels, BEL 🇧🇪 and London, UK 🇬🇧.
I'm also a dad 👦🏼👼🏼 and I speak Spanish 🇲🇽, English 🇬🇧 and French 🇫🇷 (in that order).

I always repeat these (_not really mine but I've adopted then as my principles_):

- **_Finished, not perfect_**: It's best to have something that works to show where your effort and energy has gone into, than a never ending story of a prototype or an idea that "has" to be perfect. Nothing is perfect !

- **_One thing at a time_**: I'm of the idea that if you focus all your attention, energy and dedication into the task or the problem at hand, you'll be much more likely to succeed.

- **_To go fast, you must go slow_**: So in 2021 I had a [TIA (stroke)](/posts/stroke) and specifically the recovery process, made me live this piece of advice. Go see the post for more but in a nutshell, if you really want to go fast in any direction, you need to be somewhat careful and meticulous deciding what steps to take. Otherwise you risk a fall or a misstep that will, slow you more. This, I found, is particularly useful for when you step into the unknown/uncertain.

## WORK

I'm a senior Software & Cloud Engineer. I usally work as a DevOps/SRE. I'm also certified GCP PCA, AWS CSAA & CKA. You'll usually find me working in Fintech or Cybersec.

I'm specialised in AWS (Amazon Web Services), GCP (Google Cloud Platform), OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure), Js/Ts, Python, Go, Bash, Docker, Kubernetes, Linux/UNIX.

- I'm currently working as the **CTO** of 💳 [Incredible](https://getincredible.com) where I've been doing all things tech (and a bit more)

- Before, I'm was the 1st hire, worked as a _Founding Engineer_, and predominantely worked in the **DevOps/SRE/Platform Engineering** department at ⚙️ [Lean](https://leantech.me/).

- Before, I did some **Cybersecurity Research and Technical Sales** at 🔼 [Delta Protect](https://deltaprotect.co/).

- Before that, I was **CTO** at a software company I co-founded, 🔻**VR3.io**, where I did a lot of interesting work, met awesome people and had the chance to grow very quickly as an engineer, manager and entrepreneur.

I've done a lot of _on-site_, _remote_ and _temporary contract_ jobs with clients from UK 🇬🇧, Europe 🇪🇺, Mexico 🇲🇽, but also from US 🇺🇸

Meetups, events and conferences are something I'm always looking to assist or participate in. I'm always up to help the industry grow, give some career advice and meet amazing people 😎.
